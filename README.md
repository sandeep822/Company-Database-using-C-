# Company-Database-using-Cpp
This C++ program allows users to manage company data for different companies. It prompts users for a company name, loads or creates a company data file, and presents a menu to view/add employees, view/add sales and customers, or exit. The program saves the company database to a file upon exit, following a specific file format.
